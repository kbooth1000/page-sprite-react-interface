# Page-sprite React Interface (a work in progress)

**â€¢ see live app (in progress):** https://kjb-experiments.herokuapp.com/1

One-page app interface idea based on the idea behind css image sprites (https://alistapart.com/article/sprites), but with "page" React components instead of images.

I'm using it as a playground to test out various experiments.
